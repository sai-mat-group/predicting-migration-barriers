# Predicting Migration Barriers

This repository contains the trained models built on the [Migration Barrier Dataset](https://github.com/sai-mat-group/migration-barrier-dataset/tree/main).

## Repository Structure

- Each directory contains the train and test files corresponding to a modified multi-property trained (MPT) model architecture explored in the work (**[reference to be added]**). The naming convention of these directories follows the nomenclature used in the paper.
- Training files for the **SCRATCH** model are located in:  
  `train_files/SCRATCH/`
- Raw training and test data files are stored in:  
  `DATA-FILES/`

## Installation & Usage

Instructions for installing the **ALIGNN** package and loading a pre-trained model can be found here:
