# Predicting Migration Barriers

This repository contains the trained models that are part of the manuscript, "Leveraging transfer learning for accurate estimation of ionic migration barriers in solids" by Reshma Devi, Keith Butler, and Gopalakrishnan Sai Gautam. The manuscript is currently under review, but a pre-print is available on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org). The models in this repository are built on the [Migration Barrier Dataset](https://github.com/sai-mat-group/migration-barrier-dataset/tree/main). 

## Repository Structure

- Each directory contains the train and test files corresponding to a modified multi-property trained (MPT) model architecture explored in the work (**[reference to be added]**). The naming convention of these directories follows the nomenclature used in the paper.
- Training files for the **SCRATCH** model are located in:  
  `train_files/SCRATCH/`
- Raw training and test data files are stored in:  
  `DATA-FILES/`

## Installation & Usage

Instructions for installing the **ALIGNN** package and loading a pre-trained model can be found here:

In case you use our models in your work, we will appreciate a citation to our work at [arXiv](https://arxiv.org). If you utilise the migration barrier dataset also in your work, we will appreciate a citation to the manuscript describing the dataset compilation process at [arXiv](https://arxiv.org).
